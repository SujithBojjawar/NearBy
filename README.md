Nearby helps users find nearby shops based on their preferences. Users provide a list of product categories they are interested in, assigning scores to indicate their level of interest. For example, a user might rate phones as 5, TVs as 4, laptops as 3, refrigerators as 2, and washing machines as 1. These preferences are converted into a matrix using pandas, where each row represents a user and each column represents a product category. To generate recommendations, FindNear uses the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm from scikit-learn, which finds the most relevant matches based on cosine similarity. The system first trains on user preferences, and when a user searches for a specific category, k-NN filters and ranks shops based on relevance. It then selects the top three matching shops for the given category. For example, if a user searches for TVs, FindNear might suggest shops like Gizmo Galaxy, TV Fusion, and ElectroMart. k-NN is chosen for its simplicity, speed, and efficiency, making it ideal for small datasets without requiring extensive training. Unlike complex AI models, k-NN acts as a smart filter that quickly finds the best recommendations based on user preferences, ensuring an efficient and lightweight experience.
